"""
Evidence Endpoints
==================
Serves the cropped detection imagery captured by the CV engine's
EvidenceWriter so operators can view exactly what the AI saw when an
event was raised.

The CV engine stores evidence as JPEG crops under a root directory
(``cv-engine/evidence`` by default) and references them relatively in each
event's ``evidence_ref`` (e.g. ``camd01/camd01_13133_4754ms_unknown.jpg``).
This router maps that reference to a safe absolute path inside the
configured root and streams the file.
